<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_from_November_2019_to_January_2020">first confirmed patient</a> with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics <a href="https://www.academia.edu/41743064/Systemic_Risk_of_Pandemic_via_Novel_Pathogens_-_Coronavirus_A_Note">warned</a> of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-hongkong/hong-kong-suspends-four-more-border-crossings-to-curb-spread-of-virus-idUSKBN1ZX0P6">border closures</a>, and other containment measures were <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/health/turkey-to-suspend-flights-from-china-until-end-of-month/1722860">announced</a> around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-who-idUSKBN1ZX1H3">keep their borders open</a>. Western liberal democracies <a href="https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/147576">lagged</a> in their response: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-idUSKBN2160ZP">Italy overtook China</a> as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-travel-restrictions-italy-france-germany-spain-12534476">travel ban</a> from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-france-confinement-idUSKBN2121DT">confined</a> at home indefinitely. The United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html">failed</a> to coherently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-usa-preparedness/mixed-messages-test-delays-hamper-u-s-coronavirus-response-idUSKCN20L36Z">respond</a> to the threat. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/health/usa-coronavirus-cases.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.</p>

The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/worker-at-nyc-hospital-where-nurses-wear-trash-bags-as-protection-dies-from-coronavirus/">died</a> for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments <a href="https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/who-dont-wear-face-masks">fatally misled the public</a>. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.</p>

While a loyal <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/25/china-coronavirus-propaganda-weakens-western-democracies/">liberal</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/26/21184238/coronavirus-china-authoritarian-system-democracy">press</a> duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/10/fast-facts-on-how-greeks-see-migrants-as-greece-turkey-border-crisis-deepens/">public</a> is <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/">turning</a> <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-refugees-drop-dead-angela-merkel-matteo-salvini-libya-italy-germany-refugees/">against</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/western-liberalism-failed-post-communist-eastern-europe">‘the god that failed’</a>. Europe is only one example of a <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/far-right-nationalist-climate-crisis/">growing global reaction</a>. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?</p>
<p>Even if we step back from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/">infamously</a> inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/migration-netherlands-rhetoric-and-perceived-reality-challenge-dutch-tolerance">strained</a>: with the pandemic it may <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-europe-open-borders-eu-italy-france-britain-germany-spain-a9362536.html">shatter</a>. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including <a href="https://karunadu.karnataka.gov.in/hfw/kannada/Pages/distwise-home-quarantive.aspx">publishing the home addresses</a> of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:</p>

It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly <a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/restricting-civil-liberties-amid-the-covid-19-pandemic/">elite</a> consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/civil-liberties-us-coronavirus-outbreak-policies">civil liberties</a>.

Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a <a href="https://spectator.us/new-world-order-after-coronavirus/">‘crash test’</a> for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: <em>this is a biological referendum on governance.</em></p>
<p>Whether or not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/cia-coronavirus-china.html">some</a> <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200328-brazil-s-bolsonaro-questions-coronavirus-statistics-says-sorry-some-will-die">trust</a> the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/inhuman-china-blasts-coronavirus-questions-200402113917747.html">statistics</a>, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak">masks</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/for-fox-news-hosts-the-hydroxychloroquine-controversy-is-fuel-for-the-culture-war/2020/04/10/0ec604d6-79a4-11ea-b6ff-597f170df8f8_story.html">hydroxychloroquine</a> was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/nyregion/schools-cuomo-de-blasio-nyc-coronavirus.html">contradict</a> one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-02-06/coronavirus-china-xi-li-wenliang">condemned</a> for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/04/04/coronavirus-government-dysfunction/?arc404=true">spread unchecked</a>.</p>
<p>The obvious implications here <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/26/21184238/coronavirus-china-authoritarian-system-democracy">have so far been waved away</a> by paladins of the <em>pensée unique</em>. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?</p>

<p>These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:</p>

<p>The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0_U2ym_r0">‘wet market’</a> and the Wuhan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFeo5oOuJA">lockdown</a>, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/02/03/coronavirus-outbreak-china-says-us-spreading-fear/4643737002/">to see reason</a>, China is <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/02/28/china-coronavirus-response-global/">attempting</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/world/asia/china-coronavirus-response-propaganda.html">position itself</a> as a <em>leader</em> on the virus.

The populist <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-putin-marriage/russian-constitution-must-define-marriage-as-heterosexual-putin-says-idUKKBN20P2Q8">social conservatism</a> of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-hasn-t-had-any-new-coronavirus-cases-why-is-that-1.5479374">response</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,” he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face masks to a mom and her kids.</p>
<p>Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.</p>
<p>Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in largely Chinese neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>“Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the patrols.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/covid-19-world-russia-sticks-international-distancing">‘Fortress Russia’</a> seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/21/europe/putin-coronavirus-russia-intl/index.html">from Italy</a>. As with <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/23/why-on-earth-should-anyone-believe-communist-chinas-coronavirus-statistics/">China</a>, there have been <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-russia-cases-pneumonia-deaths-putin-kremlin-fake-news-a9415771.html">accusations</a> that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could become a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.</p>
<h3 id="counterexamples-and-counterarguments">Counterexamples and counterarguments</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>What about Taiwan?</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the cases of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil-idUSKCN21V149">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/asia/hong-kong-coronavirus-quarantine-intl-hnk/index.html">Hong Kong</a>, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-02-25/how-iran-became-a-hot-zone-for-coronavirus-in-middle-east">Iran</a> have been cited by liberal apologists as against that the obvious argument sketched so far. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-is-beating-the-coronavirus-can-the-us-do-the-same/">sympathetic descriptions</a> make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel confident in government policy and social mobilization.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The bad guys lie</li>
</ol>
<p>As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/09/who-head-cries-racism-after-being-ripped-for-enabling-chinas-coronavirus-lies/">attacks</a> on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>This is just punditry</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.</p>

<h2 id="after">After?</h2>
<p>The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and retreat from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Orbán, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the <em>status quo ante</em> is far from certain.</p>
