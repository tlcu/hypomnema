    "body": "‘Read the manual’—timeless and sage advice. But what about a summary? Can one hundred words be more useful than twenty thousand? Enough developers think so to write several alternatives to the classic Unix man and GNU info systems. A quick test lookup of documentation for gpg brought surprising results:    command    language   birth year   time (ms)   words   ---------- ---------- ------------ ----------- -------   man        C          1971         81.53       21884   info       C, Perl    1986         70.86       57676   tldr       Multiple   2013         8.31        103   bro        Ruby       2014         351.17      308   cheat      Go         2014         99.92       525   eg         Python     2015         103.64      357   cheat.sh   Python     2017         141.84      91  So this was a blowout, with tldr running away with performance. Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source.

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’.

The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as evidence that the above argument is specious. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as against that the obvious argument sketched so far. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and withdrawal from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

Even though the ‘official’ client is written in JavaScript, there are Ruby, Haskell, Perl, Python, C++, Rust, Bash, and Go clients available. I had no idea that my package manager had installed the C++ client by default. There’s also a web application, Dash integration, and an iOS app available. The silver medal goes to the cheat.sh service which requires only internet access: a very interesting approach that will no doubt be useful wherever applications cannot be installed. bro kept throwing weird warnings and eg did not have gpg in it’s knowledge base, so I would not recommend them. cheat offers users an easy way to add their own content in custom ‘cheat-sheets’, with the ‘community’ cheat-sheet being little more than a default source. Honestly, I never really use info pages. Interestingly, colorless and ancient man still has the best formatting of them all:  [man]  [tldr]  [bro]  [cheat]  [eg]  [cheat-sh]"

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as against that the obvious argument sketched so far. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and retreat from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Bolsonaro, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could be a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as against that the obvious argument sketched so far. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and retreat from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Orbán, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/rusting-tools",
    "body": "There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags for some are famously cryptic, and arcana rest buried in the heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:    old skool   new school   ----------- ------------   cat         bat   find        fd   grep        ripgrep   less        bat   ls          exa  Finding a new way  Consider the case of the venerable find. Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad.

The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."

    "url": "https://www.hypomnema.net/dead-reckoning",
    "body": "  The happiest changes that have happened among the nations have usually   been bought by bloody catastrophes of which innocence was the victim.    — Joseph de Maistre  [Map of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per capita (as of 12 April 2020)]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus infected its first confirmed patient with a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019 in China. In January of the new year, well-known American academics warned of the danger the virus posed. By February lockdowns, quarantines, border closures, and other containment measures were announced around the globe. The World Health Organization publicly called for countries to keep their borders open. Western liberal democracies lagged in their response: Italy overtook China as the epicenter of the global pandemic. Singapore announced a travel ban from western Europe on March 15th. By the end of the month, the French public was confined at home indefinitely. The United States failed to coherently respond to the threat. The New York Times reported on March 26th, 2020 that ‘the U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases’.  [Mass graves in New York City]  The failure of liberal democracy hardly went unnoticed. The questions will not go away: why have so many died? The richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world failed to take basic preventative measures until it was far too late. Nations have been put under mass house arrest. Nurses and doctors needlessly died for want of basic supplies. International institutions, experts, and governments fatally misled the public. At present, most are more concerned with survival than blame. But there must be a reckoning.  [USA: coronavirus related unemployment]  Given the escalating migrant crisis and longstanding fissures within the European Union, the post-Soviet consensus is fraying. While a loyal liberal press duly attempts damage control, the evident cannot be denied: the public is turning against ‘the god that failed’. Europe is only one example of a growing global reaction. After elites refused to close Western borders and thousands rest six feet under, will average citizens be eager to throw open their doors? If ‘economic anxiety’ brought Donald Trump to the White House, what will the flat-lined world economy inspire?  Even if we step back from the infamously inexact attempt to gauge public opinion on such large questions, we can clearly see how governments are responding. Europe’s humanitarian posture was already strained: with the pandemic it may shatter. Outside the West, allied states have taken drastic measures including publishing the home addresses of quarantined people and imposing harsh personal surveillance:  A selfie an hour, will keep the police away! As many #HomeQuarantined are stepping out, the Quarantine Watch Mobile App requires these citizens to send a selfie every waking hour. If the GPS coordinates change, they will be sent to a Govt-run mass quarantine centre.#StayHome pic.twitter.com/Ofo9t80P9G — B.H.Anil Kumar,IAS (@BBMPCOMM) March 30, 2020 Public harassment is a response shared by governments and everyday people alike. So is abusive violence, from South Africa to Chechnya to Australia. Apart from a limited discussion concerning privacy, it seems clear that wherever possible tracking apps will be launched. Worldwide police enforcement, whether sweeping slums or stopping surfers, may differ in degree. Non-state actors are also stepping up to the task of population control. It is no surprise that the global pandemic should provoke fear everywhere it goes. What is noteworthy is how quickly elite consensus has settled on the need to (at least temporarily) suspend civil liberties. Early criticism of China from liberal mouthpieces has transformed into grudging praise. Some spectators have dubbed this turn of events a ‘crash test’ for Western soft power. The reality is far more sweeping: this is a biological referendum on governance.  Whether or not some trust the statistics, the overall trend is clear: liberal democracies have fared far worse than their illiberal adversaries. In America, public confusion and controversy on measures from masks to hydroxychloroquine was not limited to the vicious, constant news churn. Public officials contradict one another, as democracy requires. The Mayor of New York and the Governor of New York are structurally opposed, and the pandemic only reveals that. China was widely condemned for bungling the initial coronavirus response, but punishing doctors pales in comparison to letting the virus spread unchecked.  The obvious implications here have so far been waved away by paladins of the pensée unique. And there is little doubt that the liberal press will continue to defend the regimes that provide their platform. The world has already turned from Locke towards Hobbes. As the morgues and mass graves fill, where does the referendum stand today?  Comparing failures  The preceding paragraphs told the story, so here we will simply note the statistics (collected April 13th, 2020):    Country          Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   ---------------- -------------- ------------------   🇧🇪 Belgium       3903           337   🇫🇷 France        14393          221   🇮🇹 Italy         19899          329   🇳🇱 Netherlands   2823           165   🇪🇸 Spain         17489          374   🇸🇪 Sweden        919            91   🇬🇧 UK            10612          156   🇺🇸 USA           22115          67  These countries differ in many ways, but they all are classic liberal democracies. They all failed to keep people alive. As the death tolls are tallied we may witness far worse or better results. The present exercise cannot predict that future. We also cannot today clearly determine which statistical methods are best: should everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and then dies be counted as a COVID-19 death? Many questions of this kind menace straightforward analysis. Amid the developing crisis, and without the benefit of hindsight, let us consider the kinds of regimes acclaimed as ‘positive’ examples—governments that keep people alive—with the data we do have:  🇸🇬 Singapore    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   8              1  [Singapore coronavirus chart]  Singapore is ‘the model’ to ‘keep the coronavirus under control’, and they did it ‘without draconian measures’. The corporatist oligarchy ‘puzzles’ liberal analysis. The entrenched one-party state deployed high and low tech population control measures early, and the international commercial hub has been spared the worst.  🇰🇷 South Korea    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   217            4  [South Korea coronavirus chart]  The protectorate of the United States is certainly counted as a liberal democracy, albeit ‘fragile’ and ‘challenged’. But the ethnically homogeneous republic effectively responded with soft and hard measures. The upcoming elections in South Korea will be an early sign of how the biological referendum effects elections.  🇨🇳 China  [China coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   3341           57  The most controversial and contested case is of course the People’s Republic of China. Home of the infamous ‘wet market’ and the Wuhan lockdown, China has reported far fewer deaths than other countries. While tarnished as the source of the scourge that refused to see reason, China is attempting to position itself as a leader on the virus. At the very least, the failure of the West will give Chinese leadership a pass. If the Chinese figures prove remotely accurate, the world will marvel that the first country affected emerged nowhere near the top of the body count  🇷🇺 Russia  [Russia coronavirus chart]    Total Deaths   Deaths / 1M pop.   -------------- ------------------   148            1  Postliberal nationalism has emerged globally, encouraged by Russia’s example. But Vladimir Putin’s victories abroad are offset—if not erased—by longstanding economic and ethnic troubles at home. The populist social conservatism of Russia’s government echoed through their pandemic response:    “Put this on before you go inside, there might be Chinese in there,”   he tells a family heading into a grocery store, before handing face   masks to a mom and her kids.    Russia has adopted some of the world’s most controversial — many would   say discriminatory — measures to combat the coronavirus, including   policies specifically targeting the Chinese community.    Among them are patrols, such as the one Gorbunov is undertaking, in   largely Chinese neighbourhoods.    “Well, we read the press and they write that the virus is most   prominent among the Asian population,” says Gorbunov’s colleague   Genady Kovalov. “The danger is real, that’s why we started the   patrols.”  ‘Fortress Russia’ seems to have avoided early infections by shutting the Asian frontier, only to later import the virus from Italy. As with China, there have been accusations that the Kremlin tampers with official statistics. It remains to be seen whether such claims will affect public perception in either case. Russia could become a case study in failed quarantine if the European outbreak is not quickly contained.  Counterexamples and counterarguments  1.  What about Taiwan?  Of course, the cases of Brazil, Hong Kong, and Iran have been cited by liberal apologists as against that the obvious argument sketched so far. This objection fails to see past official ideology. Taiwan may be a friend of liberalism, but even sympathetic descriptions make the island sound like a reactionary fantasy:    Because of the opposition of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan is   not a member of the United Nations or the World Health Organization, a   fact that may paradoxically have contributed to Taiwanese faith in   their own government, according to Patrick Tung, a native of Taiwan   and a specialist in Song dynasty history. “The reality of being   isolated from global organizations,” wrote Tung, “also makes Taiwanese   very aware of the publicity of its success in handling a crisis like   this. The more coverage from foreign media, the more people feel   confident in government policy and social mobilization.”  2.  The bad guys lie  As noted above, the argument that ‘all the statistics are fake’—without a credible counter-statistics—goes nowhere. Western media attacks on the WHO for alleged pro-Chinese bias similarly lack force. All these words may indeed mean nothing in a month if the public discovers some revelatory information. But at time of writing, appeals to suspicion are little more than noise.  3.  This is just punditry  It’s impossible to escape making some assumptions about human nature, even if one insists it doesn’t exist. The figures, even if unreliable in detail, draw a clear line between those who have and have not competently responded to the coronavirus. The case made above is not backed by a rigorous model, but the reality it points to is not a matter of mere opinion. No reasonable observer can ignore the trends touched on here.  []  After?  The global rise of illiberal politics will only be accelerated by the coronavirus. The travel bans, lockdowns, unemployment, death toll, and economic crash won’t be quickly forgotten. Much of the mass policing will remain long after the last COVID-19 patient walks out of the hospital. There is no guarantee that the coronavirus will not recur seasonally, and emergency measures have been repeatedly extended already. The Western case for open borders was a tough sell before the pandemic. After—whatever that means—we will see increasing support for national sovereignty, border controls, and retreat from liberal-international institutions like the EU and the WHO. The virus will spur the movements behind Orbán, Brexit, and Trump. The international scene will continue to polarize. Tensions between the United States and China will continue to escalate. The crisis will split apart cases typically twinned: Hungary and Brazil seem to be headed down very different paths. The referendum will be decided by how competently power is applied. Conventional categories and abstract ideals blanche before death. And despite aggrieved anger, the reckoning will not come quickly. Elites will either successfully channel public outcry towards alien enemies or they will fall. Restoration of the status quo ante is far from certain."

Which of these two commands is more intuitive?      ############     # Option 1 #     ############     $ find . -name '*.md'     ./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md     ./README.md     ./src/one-small-step-for-man.md     ./src/spinning-tops.md     ./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     ./src/index.md     ./src/about.md     ############     # Option 2 #     ############     $ find --extension md     README.md     src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md     src/about.md     src/index.md     src/one-small-step-for-man.md     src/spinning-tops.md  Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in the node_modules/ directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends ./ on all the output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to search for. It colors directories like ls, simplifies output and ignores whatever is in the project’s .gitignore file. Option 1 is the classic find utility, and Option 2 is the new fd. As the README puts it:    fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.    While it does not seek to mirror all of find’s powerful functionality,   it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.  For any interactive use, fd is a clear winner.  Theory of cats  Does it matter if a cat black and white?  [cat]  [bat]  bat is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower than classic cat. Turning once again to the project’s README:    bat tries to achieve the following goals:    -   Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting   -   Integrate with Git to show file modifications   -   Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat   -   Offer a user-friendly command-line interface  bat can also serve as $PAGER, replacing more or less:  [less]  Listless lists  And yes, even ls has been improved:  [ls]  [exa]  A final blurb:    You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting   at black and white text?    exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults.   It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about   symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just   one single binary.  R.I.P grep  Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. ripgrep blows them away. The project documents the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go try it out:  [grep]  [ripgrep]  Round-up  These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user’s way, and are broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I’ve gone so far as to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them I’ve had no issues. For developers in particular, the git integrations and streamlined flags alone are worth switching."

    "body": "System monitoring is useful whether on a home desktop, workstation, or server. The classic Unix program top defines the standard interface: an interactive, filterable, running tally of what is hogging how many resources. But in the decades since release, top faces increasing competition:    command   year   language   --------- ------ ------------   top       1984   C   htop      2004   C   glances   2011   Python   vtop      2014   JavaScript   gtop      2017   JavaScript   btm       2019   Rust   zenith    2019   Rust   ytop      2020   Rust  What do these competitors offer? Mostly a better interface. For a long time htop ruled the roost, but doesn’t necessarily play well with terminal colors. The way htop graphs its data is also… rudimentary. But it’s well-known and supported, so I used it until recently I discovered that Rust developers had been working on replacements. To decide which of these alternatives is truly worthy, I decided to test them all by the following criteria:  -   how much memory and processing do they consume at idle? -   how ‘fast’ do they feel? -   how well do they handle different terminal sizes? -   do they include graphs and colors? -   how much do I like them?  First we can look at the more ‘objective’ stats. I include the minimum and maximum percent observed while running the tests on an i7 (six-core, 2.2GHz) laptop with 16GB of RAM. Some programs usage spiked, others remained steady. Hopefully reporting the numbers this way gives a sense of that. Measurements were taken from htop and results are ranked from best to worst performance:    command   min. CPU %   max. CPU %   min. MEM %   max. MEM %   --------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------   top       0.0          0.0          0.0          0.0   htop      0.1          0.2          0.0          0.0   ytop      0.2          0.9          0.0          0.0   zenith    0.0          1.9          0.1          0.1   btm       1.9          4.2          0.1          0.1   glances   0.0          7.7          0.3          0.4   vtop      3.0          6.1          0.5          0.5   gtop      3.1          7.2          0.6          0.6  In defense of glances, it does do more work than the others—including reporting to a web interface and other potentially useful server-oriented features. As for the others, the numbers speak for themselves. Let’s consider more subjective qualities: ranking from 0-3 where 0 means that a feature either is not supported or is unacceptably bad. Results are sorted by total:    command   color   scales   graphs   speed   info   like   total   --------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------ ------ -------   ytop      2       2        3        3       2      3      15   zenith    2       2        2        2       3      3      14   btm       3       1        3        1       2      2      12   htop      1       2        1        3       3      1      11   top       0       3        0        3       3      1      10   gtop      3       1        3        0       2      0      9   glances   2       1        0        0       3      0      6   vtop      1       2        2        0       1      0      6  We see here that the JavaScript tools fall behind in both performance and in functionality. The ‘like’ factor is of course very personal: if you don’t resize your windows much, the ‘scales’ column will probably impact your ‘like’ factor far less than it does mine. ytop and btm have vi-style controls which I like, and zenith lets you move back and forth in time. Below are screenshots of the tools ranked by how likely I am to use them, but none of the new Rust tools are bad choices. top isn’t going anywhere just yet.

    "body": "There’s many benefits to working from the command line. A terminal-centric workflow is broadly cross-platform, uses less system resources, is highly customizable, and most importantly fast. But only if you take a little time to get acquainted with the right tools. Take the example of moving up, down, and around the filesystem hierarchy:      $ cd example/one/two/     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/     $ cd three     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three     $ cd a/b/c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ cd     $ pwd     /home/user     $ z c     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three/a/b/c     $ z th     $ pwd     /home/user/example/one/two/three  Like tab-completion, autojump tools reduce command-line typing. Most work by remembering the most relevant and visited directories (sometimes through a ‘frecency’ algorithm) and then making educated guesses about where the user wants to go. This is obviously functionality designed around interactive shell work and not meant for scripting. There are a number of utilities built around this concept:    command    language   year first released   ---------- ---------- ---------------------   autojump   Python     2009   fasd       Shell      2011   z          Shell      2011   pazi       Rust       2017  pazi got my attention because of it’s impressive benchmarks. It also has support for using fuzzy-finders, which are themselves very useful tools. A simple alias of the default jump key z to j makes the experience even more ergonomic. The hops don’t always land where expected, especially until the tool has had enough time to learn, but skipping around saves time and needless typing overall."
