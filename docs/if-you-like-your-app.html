<blockquote>
<p>Democracy is, by the nature of it, a self-canceling business; and it gives in the long run a net result of zero.</p>
<p><em>— Thomas Carlyle</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deadly coronavirus pandemic is <a href="/dead-reckoning">spurring global reaction</a>. As the <a href="https://archive.vn/TJ6w8">body count</a> climbs, <a href="https://archive.vn/mL4ys">sluggish</a> Western governments are <a href="https://archive.vn/lfcbX">hastily mobilizing</a> their publics to <a href="https://archive.vn/LhUj9">hurry up and wait</a>. While unable to take the <a href="https://archive.vn/hKTth">simple steps</a> far ‘less developed’ nations took to <a href="https://archive.vn/uhiG0">stave off the worst</a>, the richest and most powerful societies on Earth now discuss how to best implement <a href="https://archive.vn/mvebF">unprecedented</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/NtWF4">mass</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/2nVT8">surveillance</a>. These same governments cannot provide <a href="https://archive.vn/97LQY">medical supplies</a> or <a href="https://archive.vn/atW8A">protective equipment</a> to their <a href="https://archive.vn/GXx9X">contaminated</a> hospitals <em>‘<a href="https://archive.vn/yybYU">overflowing</a> with bodies.’</em></p>

<p>The romance between <a href="https://archive.vn/DBfLE">big tech</a> and <a href="https://archive.vn/vortJ">the healthcare industry</a> is nothing new. And while <a href="https://archive.vn/yhenE">Apple and Google</a> <a href="https://archive.is/P1mKb">working together</a> to ship coronavirus-tracing to <a href="https://archive.vn/DNKEI">billions</a> has provoked <a href="https://archive.vn/yhenE">public reflection</a>, far <a href="https://archive.vn/ywqvO">more</a> is <a href="https://archive.vn/0oLk6">underway</a>. Buzzy new technologies from ‘<a href="https://archive.vn/fogiM">the blockchain</a>’ to ‘<a href="https://archive.vn/d6o9V">artificial intelligence</a>’ have never been more mainstream; their patrons never poised to reap greater rewards. Consider a <a href="https://archive.vn/qck6U">typical case</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last week, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started logging into a new web app. It promises to help them watch where COVID-19 is spreading and checks how well equipped hospitals are to deal with the spike in cases of the fatal virus, according to two sources familiar with the work. According to those sources, it was built by Palantir, a $20 billion-valued big data company whose data harvesting work for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has provoked criticism from human rights groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The uses of big <del>brother</del> tech sprout like weeds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/qTFNk">Doctors monitoring patients remotely</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/T9iFt">Bosses monitoring workers remotely</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/QE5mF">…and watching workers body temp with thermal cameras</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/bVTu5">Immunity passports to exempt from lockdowns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/5YxJr">Facial recognition to enforce lockdowns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/hAiEH">Tracing all known contacts of infected people</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/DbsOU">Reporting disobedient neighbors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/DlWo1">Drones to monitor and disinfect locked-down areas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.vn/Ed7PB">Drones to chase down lockdown breakers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not to mention the increased role of <a href="https://archive.vn/3ac38">consumer tech</a> in <a href="https://archive.vn/d73ZK">daily life</a>. The very <a href="https://archive.vn/2v39U">methods</a> the liberal press <a href="https://archive.vn/U3XWZ">routinely</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/d73ZK">decried</a> abroad are now <a href="https://archive.vn/wZVEl">applied</a> by <a href="https://archive.vn/sgXgS">liberal democracies</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/RzJby">themselves</a>. While <a href="https://archive.vn/tOVDU">some</a> have raised <a href="https://archive.vn/IIURY">concerns</a>, the crisis speaks for itself. Major public figures from <a href="https://archive.vn/t6E4L">Bill de Blasio</a> to <a href="https://archive.vn/RHL7b">Boris Johnson</a> have publicly discredited themselves. And for every cynical, structural, or materialist explanation of this big data gold rush there are ten fitful and chaotic emotions driving governments’ behavior. The world is afraid. <a href="https://archive.vn/4ThFe">Sirens</a> are the cities’ nightly lullaby and <a href="https://archive.vn/42fvq">refrigerated trucks</a> cart out the daily dead in body bags—bags whose <em><a href="https://archive.vn/b0UZJ">stocks are running out</a></em>. The coronavirus is a living nightmare, a mass house arrest, a gauntlet for millions. This leaves governments a single question: <a href="https://archive.vn/9qFK7">how quickly can we get it done?</a></p>

<p>France took playing catch-up seriously enough to <a href="https://archive.vn/1UT5">punish Amazon</a> for ignoring ‘its obligation to protect the security and health of its employees.’ Most liberal democracies however are utterly dependent on big tech: the UK’s ‘<a href="https://archive.vn/SaPMp">unthinkable</a>’ ask for access to Amazon’s ‘established delivery infrastructure’ was blandly typical. Institutional capacity has been drained from the West. Shortages of masks, beds, tests, etc. are all symptomatic of that siphoning. While <a href="https://archive.vn/wESwQ">liberal journalists</a> questioned Chinese hospital-building in February, by March Chinese students <a href="https://archive.vn/RPsEt">were fleeing</a> the sleepwalking West. Emmanuel Macron might <a href="https://archive.vn/RbWRM">not like</a> the argument, but he has no substantive response to <a href="https://archive.vn/M843l">Bruno Maçães</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What started as a catastrophe for China is shaping up to be a moment of strategic opportunity, a rare turning point in the flow of history. Suddenly, the protests in Hong Kong, carrying a mortal threat to political stability in the mainland, became a physical impossibility. More important, the pandemic set in motion a global competition, to contain the virus, for which China and the Chinese Communist Party seem uniquely prepared.</p>
<p>As the virus spread to the whole world, it became apparent that Western societies — Beijing’s true rivals — did not have the ability to quickly organize every citizen around a single goal. As opposed to China, which remains to a large extent a revolutionary society, their political systems were built for normal times. Chinese society is a mobilized army, which can quickly drop everything else and march in one direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this structural failure of liberal democracy—the lack of institutional capacity—that will thwart organized efforts to curb the virus. To be fair, Macron’s government was able to get <a href="https://archive.vn/fnsP2">a permission slip digitized</a> after only a few weeks of nationwide lockdown.</p>

<p>This deficit takes many forms, but for now let’s concentrate on why it blunts any possible cybernetic response, focusing on the example of proposed contact-tracing apps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Opt-in</li>
</ol>
<p>A <a href="https://archive.vn/wb1jy">pliant press</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/qWWMZ">assures us</a> that <a href="https://archive.vn/B7uQg">our privacy</a> and <a href="https://archive.vn/GnS1L">security</a> will not be at risk. Right or wrong, they have to make such promises. Simply keeping <a href="https://archive.vn/UdpEm">folks at home</a> has taken <a href="https://archive.vn/JqXj5">absurd effort</a>. Only buy-in from the public can get <a href="https://archive.vn/Rut9e">enough users</a> to make mass monitoring <a href="https://archive.vn/cOGIb">worthwhile</a>. Britain’s app targets <a href="https://archive.vn/QUF8t">80% of smartphone users</a>. Oft-lauded Singapore currently boasts about <a href="https://archive.vn/i2Tjf">12% adoption</a>. The many <a href="https://archive.vn/szkc7">skeptics</a> and even more unaware or lazy users will simply fail to use the app, thereby defeating it.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Apps alone</li>
</ol>
<p>Those <a href="https://archive.vn/2mDej">implementing</a> successful tracing applications understand the hard limits of the enterprise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you ask me whether any Bluetooth contact tracing system deployed or under development, anywhere in the world, is ready to replace manual contact tracing, I will say without qualification that the answer is, No. Not now and, even with the benefit of AI/ML and — God forbid — blockchain 😂 (throw whatever buzzword you want), not for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>There are critical factors (like ventilation — see below; update: or singing!) that a purely automated system will not have access to. <span class="highlight"> You cannot “big data” your way out of a “no data” situation. </span> Period.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I received feedback from the chief medical officer of a 15,000-strong organisation, pointing to the Washington choir super-spreader event, and ongoing research into how the coronavirus spreads. In this case, a contact tracing app tuned to detect 2 metre proximity would not have flagged any encounters — but a human adjusting the sensitivity thresholds of an algorithm might. Without a human-in-the-loop, matching histories across cases to contribute new knowledge to the medical community’s understanding of how the coronavirus spreads, would not be possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without <a href="https://archive.vn/oFZp8">widespread</a> and <a href="https://archive.vn/3P4VV">consistent</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/lnK0E">testing</a>, contact tracing apps are useless. Given that <a href="https://archive.vn/5F1UD">testing shortages</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/wmvK6">are the</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/Gns19">norm</a> across the Western world, there’s little cause for hope. Not to mention that governments get to play the neoliberals’ favorite game: <a href="https://archive.vn/2pP4l">shop for healthcare products</a>. Even better, it’s an app!</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">

<p>Even <a href="https://archive.vn/71aBs">within the walls</a>, big tech companies struggle to support the anti-coronavirus campaign. Are they ready for even greater responsibility? Marketing around the ‘masters of the universe’ meets reality: Apple and Google are technically incapable of deploying their proposed apps to <a href="https://archive.vn/ELAwY">two billion phones</a>.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Unruly publics</li>
</ol>
<p>America is proving increasingly <a href="https://archive.vn/NqGKf">difficult</a> to <a href="https://archive.vn/RlBj6">govern</a>. Protests—sometimes armed—have erupted from <a href="https://archive.vn/jJxzW">New Jersey</a> to <a href="https://archive.vn/HuFSM">Washington state</a>. It is painfully obvious that a population this restive after being politely asked to simply <em>do nothing</em> is not going to rush out and sign up for some surveillance app. And for every gun nut in a pickup truck rolling coal past the statehouse, there are a thousand reasonable people sick of staying home.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Even in comparatively organized <a href="https://archive.vn/hUCnm">South Korea</a>, the apps in place are frustrating the public:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]ny person with a smartphone in South Korea - almost the entire population, given that nine out of 10 South Koreans have one - gets location-based emergency messages that alert them when they are near a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.</p>
<p>People get the messages automatically and are not allowed to opt out.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Lee Yeon-ha, a university student majoring in film and media arts, says the messages have become “very annoying.”</p>
<p>“I cannot disagree with the fact that it’s good for people to know if there are infected people visiting the same places that they might go to,” he said. “But I think the government is sending these messages too frequently … I know I stopped reading them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This recalls the previous problem of ‘opt-in’ solutions, and highlights a new concern: how are everyday people supposed to make sense of all this data? Relying on the general population to do more than the most basic steps (like washing their hands) requires massive <a href="https://archive.vn/deish">state</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/efncw">intervention</a>. In the <a href="https://archive.vn/YWZjO">individualist</a> and <a href="https://archive.vn/6clGb">fractured</a> West, how is such a campaign supposed to work?</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Incompetent governance</li>
</ol>
<p>The United States can <a href="https://archive.vn/zqlou">barely</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/tUjgF">organize</a> an <a href="https://archive.vn/TxDF1">election</a>. The country just witnessed the perils of <a href="https://archive.vn/5l8ig">apps</a> in public life thanks to the <a href="https://archive.vn/4xWsz">Iowa caucus</a>. Is the homebound republic ready to stake it’s future on digital <a href="https://archive.vn/L3HVa">hanging chads</a>? The ‘<a href="https://archive.vn/kCjyC">tech-savvy</a>’ Obama administration spent <a href="https://archive.vn/1PDoV">$840 million</a> on a broken website. It’s disputable whether calling Western governments ‘tech illiterate’ is <a href="https://archive.vn/Q6WqU">understating the case</a>. Liberal democracies’ pre-existing condition—<a href="https://archive.vn/QiyKy">unfit leadership</a>—is only aggravated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>And what good will an app do when the <a href="https://archive.vn/E8JNZ">governors</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/ZAa47">themselves are</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/Pr91p">ungovernable</a>?</p>

</figure>
<p>For now, the body count is far more worrying than the magic tech beans. Silicon Valley grifts just as presidents and desperate streamers do: the Apple-Google app alliance has been a marketing masterstroke, if little else. After this narrow examination of why yet another measure to save human life fails across the world’s richest and most powerful nations, we might consider the obvious question: can such evil endure forever?</p>
