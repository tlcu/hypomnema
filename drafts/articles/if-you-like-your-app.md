The deadly coronavirus pandemic is [spurring global reaction]. As the
[body count] climbs, [sluggish] Western governments are [hastily mobilizing]
their publics to [hurry up and wait]. While unable to take the [simple steps]
far 'less developed' nations took to [stave off the worst], the richest and
most powerful societies on Earth now discuss how to best implement
[unprecedented] [mass] [surveillance]. These same governments cannot provide
[medical supplies] or [protective equipment] to their [contaminated] hospitals
_'[overflowing] with bodies.'_

The romance between [big tech] and [the healthcare industry] is nothing new.
And while [Apple and Google] [working together] to ship coronavirus-tracing
to [billions] has provoked [public reflection], far [more] is [underway].
Buzzy new technologies from '[the blockchain]' to '[artificial intelligence]'
have never been more mainstream; their patrons never poised to reap greater
rewards. Consider a [typical case]:

> In the last week, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
> started logging into a new web app. It promises to help them watch where
> COVID-19 is spreading and checks how well equipped hospitals are to deal with
> the spike in cases of the fatal virus, according to two sources familiar with
> the work. According to those sources, it was built by Palantir, a $20
> billion-valued big data company whose data harvesting work for the U.S.
> Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has provoked criticism from human
> rights groups.

The uses of big ~~brother~~ tech sprout
like weeds:

* [Doctors monitoring patients remotely]
* [Bosses monitoring workers remotely]
* [...and watching workers body temp with thermal cameras]
* [Immunity passports to exempt from lockdowns]
* [Facial recognition to enforce lockdowns]
* [Tracing all known contacts of infected people]
* [Reporting disobedient neighbors]
* [Drones to monitor and disinfect locked-down areas]
* [Drones to chase down lockdown breakers]

Not to mention the increased role of [consumer tech] in [daily life]. The very
[methods] the liberal press [routinely] [decried] abroad are now [applied] by
[liberal democracies] [themselves]. While [some] have raised [concerns], the
crisis speaks for itself. Major public figures from [Bill de Blasio] to [Boris
Johnson] have publicly discredited themselves. And for every cynical,
structural, or materialist explanation of this big data gold rush there are ten
fitful and chaotic emotions driving governments' behavior. The world is afraid.
[Sirens] are the cities' nightly lullaby and [refrigerated trucks] cart out the
daily dead in body bags---bags whose _[stocks are running out]_. The
coronavirus is a living nightmare, a mass house arrest, a gauntlet for
millions. This leaves governments a single question: [how quickly can we get it
done?]

France took playing catch-up seriously enough to [punish Amazon] for ignoring
'its obligation to protect the security and health of its employees.' Most
liberal democracies however are utterly dependent on big tech: the UK's
'[unthinkable]' ask for access to Amazon's 'established delivery
infrastructure' was blandly typical. Institutional capacity has been drained
from the West. Shortages of masks, beds, tests, etc. are all symptomatic of
that siphoning. While [liberal journalists] questioned Chinese
hospital-building in February, by March Chinese students [were fleeing] the
sleepwalking West. Emmanuel Macron might [not like] the argument, but he has no
substantive response to [Bruno Maçães]:

> What started as a catastrophe for China is shaping up to be a moment of
> strategic opportunity, a rare turning point in the flow of history. Suddenly,
> the protests in Hong Kong, carrying a mortal threat to political stability in
> the mainland, became a physical impossibility. More important, the pandemic
> set in motion a global competition, to contain the virus, for which China and
> the Chinese Communist Party seem uniquely prepared.
>
> As the virus spread to the whole world, it became apparent that Western
> societies — Beijing’s true rivals — did not have the ability to quickly
> organize every citizen around a single goal. As opposed to China, which
> remains to a large extent a revolutionary society, their political systems
> were built for normal times. Chinese society is a mobilized army, which can
> quickly drop everything else and march in one direction.

It is this structural failure of liberal democracy---the lack of institutional
capacity---that will thwart organized efforts to curb the virus. To be fair,
Macron's government was able to get [a permission slip digitized] after only
a few weeks of nationwide lockdown.

This deficit takes many forms, but for now let's concentrate on why it
blunts any possible cybernetic response, focusing on the example of
proposed contact-tracing apps:

1. Opt-in

A [pliant press] [assures us] that [our privacy] and [security] will not be
at risk. Right or wrong, they have to make such promises. Simply keeping
[folks at home] has taken [absurd effort]. Only buy-in from the public can
get [enough users] to make mass monitoring [worthwhile]. Britain's app targets
[80% of smartphone users]. Oft-lauded Singapore currently boasts about
[12% adoption]. The many [skeptics] and even more unaware or lazy users
will simply fail to use the app, thereby defeating it.

2. Apps alone

Those [implementing] successful tracing applications understand the hard
limits of the enterprise:

> If you ask me whether any Bluetooth contact tracing system deployed or under
> development, anywhere in the world, is ready to replace manual contact
> tracing, I will say without qualification that the answer is, No. Not now
> and, even with the benefit of AI/ML and — God forbid — blockchain 😂 (throw

> class='highlight'> You cannot “big data” your way out of a “no data”
> situation.  </span> Period.

> coronavirus spreads, would not be possible.

Without [widespread] and [consistent] [testing], contact tracing apps are
useless. Given that [testing shortages] [are the] [norm] across the Western
world, there's little cause for hope. Not to mention that governments get
to play the neoliberals' favorite game: [shop for healthcare products].
Even better, it's an app!

3. Walled gardens

Intellectual property laws, just-in-time supply-chains, and proprietary
technology bleed institutional capacity:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I had an email from someone who works in a virology testing lab, about why their lab is experiencing shortages of reagent. I found it really interesting and informative, so I thought I&#39;d share it, in case you do to <a href="https://t.co/Rp40F7kTHO">https://t.co/Rp40F7kTHO</a> <a href="https://t.co/Dajgae2h4z">pic.twitter.com/Dajgae2h4z</a></p>&mdash; Tom Chivers (@TomChivers) <a href="https://twitter.com/TomChivers/status/1245724620810051584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Even [within the walls], big tech companies struggle to support the
anti-coronavirus campaign. Are they ready for even greater responsibility?
Marketing around the 'masters of the universe' meets reality: Apple and Google
are technically incapable of deploying their proposed apps to
[two billion phones].

4. Unruly publics

America is proving increasingly [difficult] to [govern]. Protests---sometimes
armed---have erupted from [New Jersey] to [Washington state]. It is painfully
obvious that a population this restive after being politely asked to simply _do
nothing_ is not going to rush out and sign up for some surveillance app. And
for every gun nut in a pickup truck rolling coal past the statehouse, there are
a thousand reasonable people sick of staying home.

Even in comparatively organized [South Korea], the apps in place are
frustrating the public:

> [A]ny person with a smartphone in South Korea - almost the entire population,
> given that nine out of 10 South Koreans have one - gets location-based
> emergency messages that alert them when they are near a confirmed case of the
> novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.
>
> People get the messages automatically and are not allowed to opt out.
>
> [...]
>
> Lee Yeon-ha, a university student majoring in film and media arts, says the
> messages have become "very annoying."
>
> "I cannot disagree with the fact that it's good for people to know if there
> are infected people visiting the same places that they might go to," he said.
> "But I think the government is sending these messages too frequently … I know
> I stopped reading them."

This recalls the previous problem of 'opt-in' solutions, and highlights
a new concern: how are everyday people supposed to make sense of all this data?
Relying on the general population to do more than the most basic steps (like
washing their hands) requires massive [state] [intervention]. In the
[individualist] and [fractured] West, how is such a campaign supposed to work?

5. Incompetent governance

The United States can [barely] [organize] an [election]. The country just
witnessed the perils of [apps] in public life thanks to the [Iowa caucus].
Is the homebound republic ready to stake it's future on digital
[hanging chads]? The '[tech-savvy]' Obama administration spent [$840 million]
on a broken website. It's disputable whether calling Western governments
'tech illiterate' is [understating the case]. Liberal democracies'
pre-existing condition---[unfit leadership]---is only aggravated by the
pandemic.

And what good will an app do when the [governors] [themselves are]
[ungovernable]?

For now, the body count is far more worrying than the magic tech beans.
Silicon Valley grifts just as presidents and desperate streamers do: the
Apple-Google app alliance has been a marketing masterstroke, if little else.
After this narrow examination of why yet another measure to save human
life fails across the world's richest and most powerful nations,
we might consider the obvious
question: can such evil endure forever?
