title: Rusting tools

There are many classic command line tools known for their gotchas. The flags
for some are [famously](https://xkcd.com/1168/) cryptic, and
[arcana](https://wiki.c2.com/?EdIsTheStandardTextEditor) rest buried in the
heart of Unix. A few Rust developers have decided to refresh the scene with new
attempts at solving these epoch-old problems. These new tools are not likely to
displace programs that have decades of use in production behind them, but they
can make working in the terminal far more ergonomic:

| old skool | new school                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| cat       | [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)            |
| find      | [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)              |
| grep      | [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) |
| less      | [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)            |
| ls        | [exa](https://the.exa.website/)                  |


### Finding a new way

Consider the case of the venerable `find`. Which of these two commands is more
intuitive?

```
############
# Option 1 #
############
$ find . -name '*.md'
./node_modules/unfashionable/README.md
./README.md
./src/one-small-step-for-man.md
./src/spinning-tops.md
./src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md
./src/index.md
./src/about.md
############
# Option 2 #
############
$ find --extension md
README.md
src/a-hop-skip-and-a-jump.md
src/about.md
src/index.md
src/one-small-step-for-man.md
src/spinning-tops.md
```


Option 1 specifies the target directory, uses a single-hyphen but word-length
flag, then takes a quoted glob. Option 1 also searches everywhere, including in
the `node_modules/` directory. Finally, Option 1 prepends `./` on all the
output. Option 2 takes a double-hyphen word argument and the extension to
search for. It colors directories like `ls`, simplifies output and ignores
whatever is in the project's `.gitignore` file. Option 1 is the classic `find`
utility, and Option 2 is the new `fd`. As the
[README](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) puts it:

> fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.
>
> While it does not seek to mirror all of find's powerful functionality, it
> provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.

For any interactive use, `fd` is a clear winner.

### Theory of cats

Does it matter if a `cat` black and white?

![cat](cat.jpg '$ cat style.css')

![bat](bat.jpg '$ bat style.css')

`bat` is more functional, easier to read, more flexible, and only 1ms slower
than classic `cat`.  Turning once again to the project's
[README](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#project-goals-and-alternatives):

> bat tries to achieve the following goals:
>
> * Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting
> * Integrate with Git to show file modifications
> * Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) cat
> * Offer a user-friendly command-line interface

`bat` can also serve as `$PAGER`, replacing `more` or `less`:

![less](less.jpg '$ less style.css')

### Listless lists

And yes, even `ls` has been improved:

![ls](lsla.jpg '$ ls -la')

![exa](exala.jpg '$ exa -la')

A final [blurb](https://the.exa.website/ 'The exa website'):

> You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting at black
> and white text?
> 
> exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults. It uses
> colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks,
> extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.

### R.I.P grep

Searching at the command line has lots of alternatives. `ripgrep` [blows them
away](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/#anti-pitch). The project documents
the features and advantages so extensively that for the sake of time, just go
[try it out](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep):

![grep](grep-directory.jpg '$ grep -RI 2em .')

![ripgrep](ripgrep-directory.jpg '$ rg 2em')

### Round-up

These new tools require no configuration, get out of the user's way, and are
broadly compatible with the standard programs they replace. I've gone so far as
to alias most of the old to the new, and in about a year of working with them
I've had no issues. For developers in particular, the `git` integrations and
streamlined flags alone are worth switching.
